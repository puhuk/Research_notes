After holding [Unsupervised human video generation](../Unsupervised_video_generation/research_readme.md) subject,
I decided to solve landmark detection problems with unsupervised or self-supervised method

[This](assets/proposal.pdf) is my proposal for solving this topic

Current status is just for survey previous research and deriving ideas to solve and contribute,
there are some topics based on [previous research](assets/landmark_detection.md)

    1) Find landmarks from videos in unsupervised / self-supervised method
    2) Reshape objects from detected landmarks
    3) Reformat 3D shape from 2D images with detected landmarks
